Employing [IMDB's databases](https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/) of movies (> 340 000 records), actors (> 1 000 000 records) and the relationship between movies and actors (> 1 000 000 records) (all provided in `databases` folder), this programme (`degrees.py`) calculates the 'degrees of separation' between two user-specified actors. 

A breadth-first search alrgorithm (`QueueFrontier`) is employed, however, a depth-first search (`StackFrontier`) was also considered in the development stage (and the code for it is provided).

A demo of the programme is available here: https://youtu.be/oTRalBFbgU4
