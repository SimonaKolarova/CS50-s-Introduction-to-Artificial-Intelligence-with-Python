Mutated versions of the GJB2 gene are one of the leading causes of hearing impairment in newborns.

This programme employs a Bayesian network to determine the probability distributions of different family members to have none, one or two copies of the mutated gene and to exhibit hearing impairment given familial hearing impairment information.

Example familial hearing impairment information is provided in `data`.
