A scikit-learn K-nearest neighbour classifier for the prediction of customer online purchase completion based on 17 categorical and continuous variables (<i>e.g.</i>, number of website pages visited, whether or not the customer is a returning visitor, whether or not it is a 'special day' or the weekend etc.). 

The model was trained on a randomly selected 60% of the dataset (provided in `shopping.csv`), <i>i.e.</i>, 7399 data points, and validated using the remaining 4932 hold-out data points. 

The accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of the predictions on the validation data were 83%, 41% and 90%, respectively.
