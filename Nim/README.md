A reinforcement learning programme that can play [Nim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nim) against an user. 

The programme is iteratively trained (10 000 game sessions) using a epsilon-greedy Q-learning algorithm with a learning rate (alpha) of 0.5 and an random move selection rate (epsilon) of 0.1. The resulting AI plays optimally against an user (`play.py`).

An user <i>vs.</i> AI gameplay demo is shown [here](https://youtu.be/7zXyckDThBY).
